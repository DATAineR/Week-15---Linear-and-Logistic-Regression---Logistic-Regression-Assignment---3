    "Precision is a measure of how accurate the model's positive predictions are. It is calculated as the number of true positive predictions divided by the sum of true positive and false positive predictions. In other words, precision measures the proportion of positive predictions that are actually true positives. High precision means that the model is making very few false positive predictions, or in other words, that it is highly accurate when predicting positive outcomes.\n",

    "Recall, on the other hand, is a measure of how well the model is able to identify positive outcomes. It is calculated as the number of true positive predictions divided by the sum of true positive and false negative predictions. In other words, recall measures the proportion of actual positive cases that the model correctly identified. High recall means that the model is correctly identifying a large proportion of the positive cases in the dataset.\n",

Precision measures the accuracy of the model's positive predictions, while recall measures the ability of the model to identify positive outcomes.

The true positive rate is the proportion of positive cases that are correctly identified by the model, while the false positive rate is the proportion of negative cases that are incorrectly identified as positive by the model. By varying the threshold value used to make predictions, we can plot the true positive rate against the false positive rate and visualize the performance of the model across all possible thresholds.\n",

    "Logistic regression is a widely used algorithm for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict a binary outcome (e.g., yes or no, true or false). However, it can also be extended to handle multiclass classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common approach to using logistic regression for multiclass classification is to use a technique called one-vs-all (OVA) or one-vs-rest. In OVA, we train a separate binary logistic regression model for each class, where each model is trained to distinguish between that class and all other classes combined. For example, in a multiclass problem with three classes (A, B, and C), we would train three binary logistic regression models: one to distinguish between class A and classes B and C combined, one to distinguish between class B and classes A and C combined, and one to distinguish between class C and classes A and B combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have trained the three binary logistic regression models, we can use them to classify new samples by running them through each of the models and selecting the class with the highest probability. For example, if the probabilities output by the models for a particular sample are 0.3, 0.6, and 0.1 for classes A, B, and C, respectively, we would predict that the sample belongs to class B.\n",

    "Another approach to using logistic regression for multiclass classification is to use a technique called softmax regression or multinomial logistic regression. In softmax regression, we extend the binary logistic regression model to handle multiple classes by using a softmax activation function instead of a sigmoid activation function. The softmax function maps the output of the model to a probability distribution over the possible classes.\n",
